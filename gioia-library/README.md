California poet Dana Gioia. It integrates speech-to-text transcripts of Dana
Gioia's YouTube videos with user account management for the DAW, creating a
poetry-inspired audio processing environment.

## 🎨 Inspiration: Dana Gioia

Dana Gioia is a celebrated American poet, critic, and former Chairman of the
